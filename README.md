### WEATHER FRONT 🌧️

Weather Front compares the weather forcast between two cities. 

Currently locked to London and Berlin, with plans to add a search or dropdown list.

Each variable has a corresponding colour and size of circle, for example the warmer it is the bigger the circle and the deeper the colour. 

This was a self set project to develop my understanding of `API`'s and `JSON`

Using a trial version of `Apercu` font by [Colophon Foundry](https://www.colophon-foundry.org/typefaces/apercu/)

### 📚 What I learnt
- Actually used an `object` in my code!
- Setting `CSS` variables based on `JSON` data
- `textContent` beats `innerHTML`

### 🦺 Testing
- Works on latest version of Firefox, Chrome and Edge

### ⏳ Future improvements
- [ ] City search / selection
- [ ] Hover over word to see unit of measurement
